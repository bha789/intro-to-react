// 1. In your own words, explain the essential differences between props 
// and state in React. Which is immutable or read-only, and which changes? 
// Discuss the answer with your mentor.

// A: 
// Props are properties in a comonent that are read-only and cannot be manipulated.  
// They are passed into a component as an argument. You can also pass functions and 
// event handlers as props.

// State is read-write data that means it can be manipulated. Components can have
// state by setting, this.state, inside the constructor. Whenever state is changed, 
// then the DOM will re-render just those nodes that were altered. 

// 2. Read the React official documentation on components and props, 
// and brush up on JavaScript ES6 *classes

// A: Done. 

// 3. Built upon your component from the assignment after checkpoint 3, 
// add in state and props to make sure you have fully mastered these core
// React properties.
