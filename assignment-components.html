// 1. Peruse the Official React documentation by Facebook, note down anything
//interesting you find and discuss learnings with your mentor and Bloc Slack 
//community. In addition, discuss with your mentor a strategy to read documentation
//more efficiently. This is a critically important skill to develop as software
//developer, as technologies keep evolving.

// A: 
// Interesting Findings: 
// 1. JSX is optional, but recommended. 
// 2. JSX looks like HTML, but it's actually a syntax extension to JS. 
// 3. Elements describe what you want to see on the screen. 
// 4. Elements are immutable. 
// 5. React DOM only updates what's necessary, meaning only the specific changes. 
// 6. Components are like JS functions and take inputs called, 'props'. 
// 7. Components can also be defined as a class constructor function. 
// 8. Conditional Rendering in React works similarly to conditions in JS. 

// 2. Referring to the official documentation, build another simple React 
//component from scratch similar to the one we built. Discuss your experience 
//building the component from scratch with your mentor.
